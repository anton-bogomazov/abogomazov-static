                <p>Early in my career, I read Clean Architecture by Robert Martin and discovered the world of
                    architecture and design. It wasn’t easy to start thinking outside of layered architectures at first.
                    I quickly realised how to make a database a detail, a little later - web APIs. But it took me a
                    while to figure out how to make Spring a detail.</p>
                <p>The backends I encountered were definitely Spring-centric. It seemed like everything would fall into
                    disrepair without it. Now I understand this is a symptom of a tight coupling with framework.</p>
                <p>Finally, I put that thought aside and continued labelling my components as @Service and @Controller.
                    But one day I came across Mark Seemann’s book “Dependency Injection” and was finally able to write a
                    core application module that didn’t depend on Spring.</p>
                <p>I tried to share this knowledge with people I had mentored in one of my previous companies.
                    Immediately I found that it was as difficult for people to accept the application without Spring
                    invasion as it was for me at the time.</p>
                <p>Today I thought of a way to make learning DI a bit more fun. I like to solve coding katas and came up
                    with one about DI.</p>
                <p>I doubt it’s perfect, so I’d love to hear your feedback and improve it:
