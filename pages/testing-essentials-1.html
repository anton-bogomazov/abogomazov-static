        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>There is a noticeable trend in the software development field: terms commonly associated with unit
            testing are often misapplied.
            The associated methodologies and practices are also often misused.
            At the same time, many institutions assume that developers have sufficient knowledge about testing.
            This assumption may be due to a historical perspective where testing was seen as an auxiliary
            element of a project - a task that had to be handled “somehow”.
            Symbolically, code coverage became the sole criterion for evaluating the quality of testing for many
            projects, which is not considered adequate.</p>
        <p>I believe it’s important to have a solid understanding of unit testing because a good test suite is
            one of the pillars of a project’s agility.
            This is exactly the kind of quality we’re aiming for in our fast-paced world of elusive business
            opportunities.</p>
        <h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>
        <p><strong>Regression</strong> (<strong>software bug</strong>) is a situation when a feature stops
            functioning as intended after modifications have been applied.</p>
        <p><strong>System Under Test (SUT)</strong> is what is being tested.</p>
        <p><strong>Test Double</strong> is a production object substitute for testing purposes.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-the-unit-test">What is the Unit Test?</h2>
        <p><strong>Unit test</strong> is a piece of code (test method) that triggers another piece of code (SUT)
            and assesses the correctness of specific assumptions afterward (assertions).
            If these assumptions are proven incorrect, the unit test is considered to be failed.</p>
        <p>This general definition is not very helpful in navigating modern testing because it doesn’t allow us
            to separate the different categories of tests.
            Also, it does not indicate that unit tests are automated. Therefore, I prefer the stricter one given
            by Vladimir Khorikov [1]:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Unit test is an automated test that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verifies a single unit of behavior</li>
                <li>Does it quickly</li>
                <li>Does it in isolation from other tests</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here we would like to emphasize that <em>unit testing of sole integration with infrastructure is not
            integration testing</em> by definition. [1] [2]</p>
        <p>It is often very difficult to write such a test meeting the last 2 criteria, and also usually the
            logic of such integrations is trivial,
            so such interactions are tested as part of other tests at higher levels (integration, e2e).</p>
        <p>Now, let’s delve into the concepts of “unit” and “isolation”.
            To grasp these concepts, we need to explore 2 approaches, as they define these terms
            differently.</p>
        <h2 id="two-views-on-unit-testing">Two views on Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>When discussing the two schools unit testing, I will utilize the terms coined by Jay Fields, as I
            consider them to be the most accurate.
            Furthermore, I will present all the names under which you might encounter these terms.</p>
        <h3 id="sociable-unit-test">Sociable Unit Test</h3>
        <p>Verifies a single <em>unit of behavior</em> in <em>isolation from other tests</em>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Also known as: Detroit/Chicago school of unit testing, classicist approach,
                state-based/inside-out/black-box testing.
            </li>
            <li>Practitioners: Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Robert Martin.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A unit of behavior can be a command or a business transaction.</li>
            <li>SUT is the class under test with all its private dependencies.</li>
            <li>Isolation of tests from each other. Avoid a situation where 2 tests from one suite could
                interfere with each other by mutating shared dependency.
            </li>
            <li>Can be described as “passing X and Y to SUT, I expect the result R”.</li>
            <li>Shared out-of-process [classic] OR shared <em>unmanaged</em> out-of-process [modern]
                dependencies should be mocked. [3]
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>
                    <code>
"lock account and notify user after 3 failed authorization attempts" {
    val database = testDatabase()
    val messageBusMock = mockk&ltMessageBus&gt()
    val notificator = Notificator(messageBusMock)
    val repository = Repository(database)
    val sut = AuthorizationManager(notificator, repository)

    val result = sut.authorize(userId = 15, authData = authData())

    result shouldBe false
    repository.isUserBlocked(userId = 15) shouldBe true
    verify(exactly = 1) { messageBusMock.sendEvent(alertEvent(userId = 15)) }
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
        <p>I use a single mock for the unmanaged MessageBus, as it is the only dependency whose state I cannot
            observe from the application.
            The other collaborators are configured exclusively for each test.</p>
        <p>Effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Written tests make sense: I invoke the command, I get the result.</li>
            <li>Focus shifts from implementation to behavior.</li>
            <li>Not tied to implementation details -> resistant to refactoring. Sometimes knowing just the name
                of the method being tested may be enough.
            </li>
            <li>Tests the logic of a cluster of classes (SUT + dependencies).</li>
            <li>In case of regression, fail in multiple tests. For example, if bug in some class, dependent
                classes are likely to fail as well.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="solitary-unit-test">Solitary Unit Test</h3>
        <p>Verifies a single <em>unit of code</em> in <em>isolation from any dependencies</em>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Also known as: London school of unit testing, mockist approach,
                interaction-based/outside-in/white-box testing
            </li>
            <li>Practitioners: Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A unit of code is SUT.</li>
            <li><em>Complete</em> isolation of SUT from <em>any</em> dependencies. Dependencies are replaced by
                Test Doubles.
            </li>
            <li>Can be described as “passing X and Y to SUT, I expect invocation of methods F1 of collaborator A
                and F2 of collaborator B with arguments ARG1 and ARG2”.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>
                    <code>
"lock account and notify user after 3 failed authorization attempts" {
    val notificatorMock = mockk&ltNotificator&gt()
    every { notificatorMock.sendAlert(alertEvent(userId = 15)) }.returns(true)
    val repositoryMock = mockk&ltRepository&gt()
    every { repositoryMock.blockAccount(userId = 15) }.returns(true)
    val sut = AuthorizationManager(notificatorMock, repositoryMock)

    val result = sut.authorize(userId = 15, authData = authData())

    result shouldBe false
    verify(exactly = 1) { notificatorMock.sendAlert(alertEvent(userId = 15)) }
    verify(exactly = 1) { repositoryMock.blockAccount(userId = 15) }
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
        <p>Effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on implementation.</li>
            <li>Each test checks the logic of a single class in full isolation.</li>
            <li>Strongly tied to implementation details -> not resistant to refactoring and SUT changes.</li>
            <li>Easy to write - no need to configure dependencies, which may also have dependencies, and so
                on.
            </li>
            <li>Tests tend to be too granular or even trivial: every bit of logic is tested instead of real
                operations and commands.
            </li>
            <li>Due to the high granularity, in the case of regression in class A, you will see a single fail at
                the corresponding location.
            </li>
        </ul>
