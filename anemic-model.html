        <h1>Anemic Domain Model Pattern</h1>
        <article>
            <p>The Anemic Domain Model (ADM) refers to a very common anti-pattern where the domain model objects
                lack behavior and encapsulate only data. The business rules and operations are typically implemented
                in separate service layers.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I want to note that ADM is not limited to domain-driven designed systems; it applies to any
                object-oriented system. As Martin Fowler stated, “<em>The fundamental horror of this anti-pattern is
                    that it’s so contrary to the basic idea of object-oriented design, which is to combine data and
                    process together.</em>” Separating behavior from data leads to a lack of cohesion between them
                and reduced data encapsulation.</p>
            <p>Also, it’s essential to highlight that there are cases where a simple data structure is sufficient,
                e.g. data transfer object (DTO). It is also OK to implement it in case of very simple business logic
                (Active Record Pattern).</p>
            <p>ADM is characterized by the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anemic domain objects are typically data structures without any behavior, often mirroring
                    database tables.
                </li>
                <li>Business logic is spread across various layers, leading to a lack of expressiveness in the
                    class. The service layer becomes bloated as the model delegates work on its properties to the
                    service layer.
                </li>
                <li>Domain objects are often tightly coupled with service layers, violating encapsulation and
                    separation of concerns.
                </li>
                <li>OOD principles are violated. In extreme cases, services are simply a set of methods and then the
                    system becomes procedural.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drawbacks of the Anemic Domain Model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced data encapsulation. By separating behavior from domain objects, we are forced to open up
                    the attributes of the model for modification by the service layer. In addition to the redundant
                    propagation of knowledge about model attributes, this can lead to the existence of invalid
                    instances in the runtime. In turn, this leads to a spreading of validations and checks in the
                    components working with the object.
                </li>
                <li>Decreased maintainability, increased complexity, and limited expressiveness. With business logic
                    scattered across different layers, making changes or adding new features becomes more complex
                    and error-prone; as well as understanding the model.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why does the anemic model matter?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A rich domain model may introduce performance overhead due to defensive copying in the case of
                    immutable models and repetitive validations. Some can be mitigated.
                </li>
                <li>Rich domain models may have compatibility issues with frameworks, particularly in mapping.</li>
                <li>Developing a correct model is a challenging task. Sometimes using an anemic model is a
                    reasonable compromise.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>How to avoid it?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the OO design principles.</li>
                <li>Consider using private setters for your properties. This way you do not have to rely on external
                    validations.
                </li>
                <li>Use constructors with parameters. It’s essential to check passed parameters to initialize an
                    object in the valid state.
                </li>
            </ul>
