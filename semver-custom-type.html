        <h1>Postgres Semver Implementation</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                A rich type system allows for more accurate modeling of different aspects of your application, which directly improves its quality.
                But obviously, tools and libraries cannot provide us with types for everything under the sun, often limiting us to general-purpose types.
                Therefore, the need to implement something custom constantly arises when we model our domains.
                Recently, I found myself in a situation where I needed to save a versioned model into a database.
                After a search for a suitable Semver type in Postgres and not finding one, I realized that I need to develop this type myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing the type in the database turned out to be a rather trivial task, requiring only defining the structure and comparison operations for the type.
                But when it came to mapping this type in the ORM (as always with Hibernate), problems started to arise.
                Despite Hibernate, offering clear tools for extending the standard RDB dialects (<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.6/javadocs/org/hibernate/usertype/UserType.html">UserType interface</a>),
                I couldn’t achieve clear and elegant code by implementing it.
                Therefore, I turned to a well-known library, <a href="https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hypersistence-utils">Hypersistence</a> by Vlad Mihalcea,
                which provides classes like MutableType and ImmutableType, significantly reducing boilerplate code for type implementation and offering a much more pleasant interface.
                One minor drawback I consider in my solution is the unsafe handling of Postgres types, caused by the fact that the Postgres driver is a runtimeOnly dependency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now let’s see how to do this using the example of the Release entity, which represents a description of a new release and includes a version in Semver format.
                Let’s start with a basic test for saving the entity and its naive implementation:
            </p>
            <pre>
                    <code>
@Test
fun `release can be persisted`() {
    val e = ReleaseEntity(
        version = Semver("0.1.0"),
        description = ReleaseDescription("First release"),
    )

    sut.save(e)

    assert(sut.findOne(Example.of(e)).isPresent)
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <pre>
                    <code>
@Entity
@Table(name = "releases")
data class ReleaseEntity(
    @Id
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID(),
    val version: Semver,
    val description: ReleaseDescription,
)

@JvmInline value class Semver(private val value: String)
@JvmInline value class ReleaseDescription(private val value: String)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <pre>
                    <code>
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS releases (
    id          UUID    PRIMARY KEY,
    version     SEMVER  NOT NULL,
    description TEXT    NOT NULL
);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                As you can see, the ReleaseEntity uses primitive strings to store version and description.
                Test is green, everything works great!
            </p>

            <p>
                Now let’s check if the sorting criteria for the Release entity work correctly.
                There are no specific requirements for sorting by description; lexicographical order is expected.
                But what about version? It seems that lexicographical order should be also sufficient:
            </p>
            <p>["0.0.1", "0.1.1", "0.1.0"] -> ["0.0.1", "0.1.0", "0.1.1"]</p>

                <p>The ASCII code for the dot (.) character conveniently falls below 0:</p>

            <p>["1.0.0", "10.0.0"] -> ["1.0.0", "10.0.0"] // works like a charm</p>

            <p>
                But of course, that’s not true, otherwise this article wouldn’t exist!
                As soon as identifiers longer than one digit appear, lexicographical order can be misleading:
            </p>
            <p>["10.10.10", "2.0.0"] -> ["10.10.10", "2.0.0"] // incorrect!</p>
            <p>
                When comparing versions like “10.10.10” and “2.0.0”, “2.0.0” would appear larger because during comparison of the first character, it’s found that 2 > 1.
                Clearly, a naive implementation doesn’t allow us to compare string representation of Semvers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s proceed with the correct implementation now. We’ll describe the data type in the database, domain type in the app and mapping between these types:
            </p>
            <pre>
                    <code>
CREATE TYPE SEMVER AS (
    major int,
    minor int,
    patch int
);
-- ton of code, check <a href="https://github.com/anton-bogomazov/semver-pg-type">github</a>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <pre>
                    <code>
data class Semver(
    val major: Int,
    val minor: Int,
    val patch: Int,
)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <pre>
                    <code>
class SemverType : ImmutableType&ltSemver&gt(Semver::class.java) {
/* implementation */
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Finally add the new type and its mapping to the Release entity:
            </p>
            <pre>
                    <code>
@Entity
@Table(name = "releases")
data class ReleaseEntity(
    @Id
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID(),
    @Type(SemverType::class)
    val version: Semver,
    val description: ReleaseDescription,
)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Done! We now have a much more expressive type, resulting in correct sorting functionality.
            </p>
